## üéì Guiding Principles for AI Coding

### When Adding Features:
1. **Always maintain backwards compatibility** with existing exports
2. **Follow the existing pattern**: Each clustering method is a class with `fit_predict()` and `export_cluster_profile()`
3. **Update all three methods** when adding shared functionality
4. **Configuration over code**: Add new parameters to `config.yml`, not hardcoded
5. **Document comprehensively**: Update README.md and create specific docs
6. **Test thoroughly**: Run all clustering methods after changes

### Code Style:
- **Docstrings**: Every class and method needs comprehensive docstrings
- **Type hints**: Use type annotations for all parameters and returns
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages
- **Logging**: Use print statements for user feedback, not silent failures
- **Modularity**: Keep classes focused on single responsibility

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Consistent interfaces**: All clustering classes follow the same API
- **Separation of concerns**: Data generation, clustering, enrichment, export are separate modules
- **Config-driven**: Behavior controlled by YAML, not code changes
- **Export-first**: Always think about how LLMs will consume the data

## üí° Innovation Opportunities

### 1. Hybrid Clustering
Combine multiple algorithms for ensemble segmentation:
- Vote on cluster assignments across methods
- Weighted confidence scoring
- Meta-clustering on clustering results

### 2. Explainable AI
Add interpretability features:
- SHAP values for feature importance
- Decision tree approximations of clusters
- Natural language explanations of why customer is in segment

### 3. Active Learning
Let marketers refine segments:
- Label examples as good/bad segment fits
- Retrain models with feedback
- Continuous improvement loop

### 4. Time-Series Segmentation
Track customer evolution:
- Segment migration over time
- Lifecycle stage transitions
- Predict next segment move

## üìù Notes for AI Agents

### When I Ask to Add Features:
- Check if it fits the **long-term vision** (production-ready, LLM-integrated)
- Maintain **consistency** across all three clustering methods
- Update **documentation** alongside code
- Think about **scalability** and **real-world usage**

### When Debugging:
- Always validate against **current config.yml** structure
- Check that exports remain **LLM-compatible**
- Ensure **all three methods** still work after changes

### When Refactoring:
- Keep the **public API stable** (methods, return values)
- Improve **internal organization** without breaking examples
- Add **deprecation warnings** before removing features

## ü§ù Contributing Philosophy

This is a **POC evolving toward production**. Contributions should:
- Advance toward the long-term vision
- Maintain code quality and documentation standards
- Include examples demonstrating new features
- Consider real-world retail business needs
