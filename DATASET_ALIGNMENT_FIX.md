# Dataset Alignment Fix

## Date: October 17, 2025
## Issue: ValueError - Length mismatch between basic and enriched datasets
## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

### Error Message:
```
ValueError: Length of values (100) does not match length of index (500)
```

### Root Cause:
The segmentation pipeline was:
1. **Clustering** on basic dataset: 100 customers
2. **Enrichment** on enriched dataset: 500 customers
3. Trying to apply 100 cluster labels to 500 customers ‚Üí **MISMATCH**

### Why It Happened:
- Basic and enriched datasets were generated at different times
- Basic dataset: `customer_sales_data_basic.csv` (100 customers)
- Enriched dataset: `customer_sales_data_enriched.csv` (500 customers)
- Pipeline assumes both datasets have the **same customers** in the **same order**

---

## Solution Implemented

### Added Dataset Validation in `run_segmentation_pipeline.py`

When loading existing datasets, the pipeline now:

1. **Checks for size mismatch**
   ```python
   if len(customer_data_basic) != len(customer_data_enriched):
       # Detect and report mismatch
   ```

2. **Aligns enriched dataset to basic dataset**
   ```python
   # Filter enriched to only include customers in basic
   basic_ids = customer_data_basic['customer_id'].tolist()
   customer_data_enriched = customer_data_enriched[
       customer_data_enriched['customer_id'].isin(basic_ids)
   ]
   ```

3. **Ensures same customer order**
   ```python
   # Reorder enriched to match basic
   customer_data_enriched = customer_data_enriched.set_index('customer_id')
                                                   .loc[basic_ids]
                                                   .reset_index()
   ```

4. **Validates order even for same-length datasets**
   ```python
   # Check if customer_id order matches
   if basic_ids != enriched_ids:
       # Reorder enriched dataset
   ```

## Code Changes

### Location: `examples/run_segmentation_pipeline.py`

**Lines 63-97:** Added dataset validation and alignment logic

```python
# Check if data already exists
if basic_data_path.exists() and enriched_data_path.exists():
    print(f"‚úÖ Loading existing datasets:")
    print(f"   - Basic: {basic_data_path}")
    print(f"   - Enriched: {enriched_data_path}")
    customer_data_basic = pd.read_csv(basic_data_path)
    customer_data_enriched = pd.read_csv(enriched_data_path)
    
    # CRITICAL: Ensure both datasets have the same customers in the same order
    if len(customer_data_basic) != len(customer_data_enriched):
        print(f"\n‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Dataset size mismatch!")
        print(f"   Basic: {len(customer_data_basic)} customers")
        print(f"   Enriched: {len(customer_data_enriched)} customers")
        print(f"   Aligning datasets to match basic dataset...")
        
        # Align enriched to match basic dataset customer IDs
        if 'customer_id' in customer_data_basic.columns and 'customer_id' in customer_data_enriched.columns:
            basic_ids = customer_data_basic['customer_id'].tolist()
            customer_data_enriched = customer_data_enriched[customer_data_enriched['customer_id'].isin(basic_ids)]
            # Ensure same order
            customer_data_enriched = customer_data_enriched.set_index('customer_id').loc[basic_ids].reset_index()
            print(f"   ‚úÖ Aligned enriched dataset: {len(customer_data_enriched)} customers")
        else:
            print(f"   ‚ùå Cannot align - missing customer_id column")
            print(f"   Regenerating datasets...")
            raise ValueError("Dataset mismatch - please delete both files and regenerate")
    else:
        # Ensure same order even if same length
        if 'customer_id' in customer_data_basic.columns and 'customer_id' in customer_data_enriched.columns:
            basic_ids = customer_data_basic['customer_id'].tolist()
            enriched_ids = customer_data_enriched['customer_id'].tolist()
            if basic_ids != enriched_ids:
                print(f"   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Customer order mismatch - reordering enriched dataset...")
                customer_data_enriched = customer_data_enriched.set_index('customer_id').loc[basic_ids].reset_index()
                print(f"   ‚úÖ Reordered enriched dataset")
```

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: Size Mismatch (100 vs 500)
```
Before Fix:
‚îú‚îÄ Basic: 100 customers (CUST_00001 to CUST_00100)
‚îî‚îÄ Enriched: 500 customers (CUST_00001 to CUST_00500)
‚ùå ERROR: Cannot apply 100 labels to 500 customers

After Fix:
‚îú‚îÄ Basic: 100 customers (CUST_00001 to CUST_00100)
‚îî‚îÄ Enriched: 100 customers (CUST_00001 to CUST_00100) ‚Üê FILTERED
‚úÖ SUCCESS: 100 labels applied to 100 customers
```

### Scenario 2: Order Mismatch (same count, different order)
```
Before Fix:
‚îú‚îÄ Basic: [CUST_00001, CUST_00003, CUST_00002]
‚îî‚îÄ Enriched: [CUST_00001, CUST_00002, CUST_00003]
‚ùå ERROR: Labels assigned to wrong customers

After Fix:
‚îú‚îÄ Basic: [CUST_00001, CUST_00003, CUST_00002]
‚îî‚îÄ Enriched: [CUST_00001, CUST_00003, CUST_00002] ‚Üê REORDERED
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Labels correctly aligned
```

### Scenario 3: Perfect Match
```
‚îú‚îÄ Basic: 500 customers in order
‚îî‚îÄ Enriched: 500 customers in same order
‚úÖ No action needed
```

## User Instructions

### Option 1: Let the Pipeline Align (Recommended)
Simply run the pipeline - it will automatically align the datasets:

```bash
cd examples
python run_segmentation_pipeline.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Loading existing datasets:
   - Basic: data\customer_sales_data_basic.csv
   - Enriched: data\customer_sales_data_enriched.csv

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Dataset size mismatch!
   Basic: 100 customers
   Enriched: 500 customers
   Aligning datasets to match basic dataset...
   ‚úÖ Aligned enriched dataset: 100 customers
```

### Option 2: Regenerate Both Datasets (Clean Start)
Delete existing datasets and generate fresh ones:

```bash
cd data
del customer_sales_data_basic.csv
del customer_sales_data_enriched.csv
cd ../examples
python run_segmentation_pipeline.py
```

The pipeline will generate matched datasets:
```
üìä Generating NEW datasets with persona support...
   ‚úÖ Generated 500 customers (both basic and enriched)
```

---

## Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Always generate both datasets together** using `dataset_type='both'`
2. **Use the same n_customers** for both datasets
3. **Keep datasets synchronized** - if you update one, update both
4. **Let the pipeline generate data** instead of manual generation

### ‚ùå DON'T:
1. Generate basic and enriched datasets separately at different times
2. Modify one dataset without updating the other
3. Manually filter customers from one dataset
4. Change n_customers in config after generating datasets

---

## Technical Details

### Why Alignment is Needed

The pipeline architecture:
```
1. Load BASIC dataset (N customers)
2. Run clustering on BASIC ‚Üí produces N cluster labels
3. Load ENRICHED dataset (must be same N customers)
4. Apply N cluster labels to ENRICHED ‚Üí requires exact match
5. Analyze enriched features by cluster
```

If datasets don't match:
- **Size mismatch:** Cannot assign labels (pandas ValueError)
- **Order mismatch:** Labels assigned to wrong customers (silent error!)

### Alignment Strategy

**Priority:** Basic dataset is the "source of truth"
- Clustering uses basic dataset (757 features)
- Enriched dataset must match basic customers exactly
- Alignment: Filter and reorder enriched to match basic

**Rationale:**
- Basic dataset defines which customers we're clustering
- Enriched dataset provides additional details for those customers
- Must maintain 1:1 correspondence

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Size Mismatch
**Setup:**
- Basic: 100 customers
- Enriched: 500 customers

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS
- Pipeline detects mismatch
- Filters enriched to 100 customers
- Clustering completes successfully

### Test Case 2: Order Mismatch
**Setup:**
- Basic: 100 customers (random order)
- Enriched: 100 customers (different order)

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS
- Pipeline detects order difference
- Reorders enriched to match basic
- Clustering completes successfully

### Test Case 3: Perfect Match
**Setup:**
- Basic: 500 customers
- Enriched: 500 customers (same order)

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS
- No alignment needed
- Clustering completes immediately
